# WooCommerce Single Product Form Improvements

This document outlines the changes made to improve the single product form functionality:

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend (content-single-product.php)
- **Fixed quantity controls**: Updated button classes from `.quantity-minus/plus` to `.minus/.plus` to match the HTML structure
- **Added quantity validation**: Ensures quantity never goes below 1
- **Improved AJAX handling**:
  - Separate handlers for variable and simple products
  - Proper validation before submission
  - Cart redirection after successful add to cart
- **Dynamic pricing**: Replaced hardcoded price with `$product->get_price_html()`
- **Unique IDs**: Generated unique IDs for quantity inputs to avoid conflicts

### 2. Backend (functions.php)
- **Added new AJAX handlers**:
  - `custom_variable_add_to_cart_handler()` for variable products
  - `custom_simple_add_to_cart_handler()` for simple products
- **Enhanced validation**:
  - Nonce security verification
  - Product existence checks
  - Stock availability validation
  - Variation validation for variable products
- **Cart integration**:
  - Proper WooCommerce cart addition
  - Cart fragments support
  - Disabled default WooCommerce redirect to allow custom handling

### 3. Security & Validation
- **Quantity validation**: Minimum quantity of 1 enforced on both frontend and backend
- **Nonce protection**: All AJAX requests require valid nonce
- **Input sanitization**: All user inputs are properly sanitized
- **Product validation**: Checks for product existence, stock status, and variation validity

### 4. User Experience
- **Cart redirection**: After successful add to cart, user is redirected to cart page
- **Loading states**: Button shows "Adding..." during AJAX request
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages for various failure scenarios
- **Responsive design**: Form maintains responsive layout

## How It Works

1. **Variable Products**:
   - User selects variation options (size, color, etc.)
   - Form validates all required variations are selected
   - Sends AJAX request to `custom_variable_add_to_cart` action
   - Backend validates variation and adds to cart
   - User is redirected to cart page

2. **Simple Products**:
   - User sets quantity (minimum 1)
   - Form sends AJAX request to `custom_simple_add_to_cart` action
   - Backend validates product and adds to cart
   - User is redirected to cart page

## Testing Checklist

- [x] **Dynamic Product Form**: Form now dynamically adapts to variable vs simple products
- [x] **Variation Selection**: Properly detects when all variations are selected
- [x] **Button State Management**: Add to cart button enables/disables based on variation selection
- [x] **Dynamic Data**: Product ID, variations, and URLs are now dynamic instead of hardcoded
- [ ] Variable product: Select variations and add to cart
- [ ] Simple product: Add to cart with different quantities
- [ ] Quantity validation: Try to set quantity below 1
- [ ] Error handling: Try adding out of stock products
- [ ] Cart redirection: Verify redirect to cart page after successful addition
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness: Test on mobile devices
