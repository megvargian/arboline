## Color Families for Filtering

Colors are grouped into families for the filter buttons on the Paint Color Picker page:

- **Reds** - Red, burgundy, crimson colors
- **Oranges** - Orange, coral, terracotta colors
- **Yellows** - Yellow, gold, amber colors
- **Greens** - Green, olive, sage colors

- **Purples** - Purple, violet, mauve colors
- **Neutrals** - Beige, taupe, greige colors
- **Whites** - White, cream, ivory colors
- **Blacks** - Black, charcoal, dark gray colors

## Tips

### RGB Values Format
- Enter RGB values as: `R, G, B`
- Example: `200, 16, 46` for a red color
- The values should be between 0-255

### Hex Color Picker
- The hex color picker allows you to choose the exact color visually
- You can also paste a hex code directly (e.g., #C8102E)
- The color swatch will update immediately

### LRV (Light Reflectance Value)
- LRV measures how much light a color reflects
- Range: 0 (pure black) to 100 (pure white)
- Higher values = lighter colors
- Lower values = darker colors

## Where Colors Appear

Colors added through ACF will automatically appear on:
1. **Paint Color Picker Page** - Main color wall display
2. **Color Family Filters** - Filter buttons at the top
3. **Color Detail Modal** - When users click on a color swatch
